# Grouping System

The grouping system allows you to organize ingress resources in different ways to match your workflow and make it easier to find and manage ingresses.

## Overview

The grouping selector is located in the dashboard header, next to the search and filter controls. It provides three grouping modes that change how ingresses are displayed on the dashboard.

## Grouping Modes

### None (Default)

Displays all ingresses in a single responsive grid without any grouping.

**Best for:**
- Small to medium number of ingresses
- When you want to see everything at once
- Quick scanning of all resources

### By Namespace

Organizes ingresses into separate sections, one for each namespace.

**Features:**
- Each namespace gets its own section with a header
- Section headers show the namespace name and ingress count
- Empty namespaces are shown with zero count
- Sections are sorted alphabetically by namespace name

**Best for:**
- Multi-tenant clusters
- Organizing by team or project
- Isolating ingresses by environment (if using namespace-based environments)

**Example:**
```
Namespace: default (5)
[Ingress cards for default namespace]

Namespace: production (12)
[Ingress cards for production namespace]

Namespace: staging (8)
[Ingress cards for staging namespace]
```

### By TLS Status

Organizes ingresses into two groups based on TLS configuration.

**Features:**
- Two sections: "TLS Enabled" and "TLS Disabled"
- Each section shows the count of ingresses
- Both sections are always visible, even if empty
- Helps identify ingresses that need TLS configuration

**Best for:**
- Security audits
- Identifying ingresses without TLS
- Ensuring compliance with security policies
- Migration to HTTPS

**Example:**
```
TLS Enabled (18)
[Ingress cards with TLS configured]

TLS Disabled (3)
[Ingress cards without TLS]
```

## Using Grouping

### Selecting a Grouping Mode

1. Click the grouping selector dropdown in the dashboard header
2. Choose your desired grouping mode
3. The dashboard updates immediately to show the new grouping

### URL Persistence

The selected grouping mode is automatically saved in the URL:
- `/?group=none` - No grouping
- `/?group=namespace` - Group by namespace
- `/?group=tls` - Group by TLS status

This allows you to:
- Bookmark your preferred grouping mode
- Share links with specific grouping
- Navigate back/forward through grouping changes

## Interaction with Filters

Grouping works seamlessly with search and filters:

### With Search
- Search applies across all groups
- Empty groups are shown if no ingresses match
- Group counts update to reflect filtered results

### With Namespace Filter
- When filtering by namespace, only selected namespaces appear
- Group counts reflect the filtered set
- Other groups show zero count if filtered out

### With Label/Annotation Filters
- Filters apply within each group
- Group counts update based on filter results
- Empty groups remain visible

## Performance

The grouping system is optimized for performance:
- Grouping calculations are memoized
- Only visible groups are rendered
- Smooth transitions between grouping modes
- No performance impact on large ingress lists

## Keyboard Navigation

Navigate between groups using keyboard:
- Tab through ingress cards within each group
- Logical tab order maintained across groups
- Focus indicators clearly visible

## Best Practices

### For Small Clusters (< 20 ingresses)
Use "None" grouping for simplest view.

### For Multi-Namespace Clusters
Use "By Namespace" grouping to organize by team or project.

### For Security Reviews
Use "By TLS Status" grouping to identify ingresses needing TLS.

### For Mixed Workflows
Switch between grouping modes as needed - your preference is saved in the URL.

## Examples

### Finding Ingresses Without TLS

1. Select "By TLS Status" grouping
2. Look at the "TLS Disabled" section
3. Review each ingress and add TLS configuration as needed

### Reviewing a Specific Namespace

1. Select "By Namespace" grouping
2. Scroll to the namespace section
3. Review all ingresses in that namespace

### Sharing a Grouped View

1. Select your desired grouping mode
2. Copy the URL from the browser
3. Share with team members - they'll see the same grouping
