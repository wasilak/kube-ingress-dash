# Features Overview

Kube Ingress Dash provides a comprehensive set of features for monitoring and managing Kubernetes ingress resources.

## Core Features

### Real-time Ingress Monitoring

Watch ingress resources update in real-time using Server-Sent Events (SSE). Changes to ingresses are automatically reflected in the dashboard without requiring page refreshes.

### Multi-Namespace Support

Monitor ingresses across multiple namespaces simultaneously. The dashboard provides a namespace filter that allows you to:
- View all namespaces at once
- Filter to specific namespaces
- Quickly switch between namespace views

### Advanced Search and Filtering

Quickly find ingresses using the powerful search functionality:
- Search by ingress name
- Search by namespace
- Search by host
- Search by path
- Real-time filtering as you type
- URL-based search persistence (shareable search links)

### Flexible Grouping System

Organize ingresses in different ways to match your workflow:

- **None**: View all ingresses in a single grid (default)
- **By Namespace**: Organize ingresses into separate sections per namespace
- **By TLS Status**: Group ingresses by TLS enabled/disabled status

Grouping mode is persisted in the URL for easy bookmarking and sharing.

### Detailed Ingress Information

Click the details icon on any ingress card to view comprehensive information:

- **Main Details**: Name, namespace, creation timestamp, status, and ingress class
- **Labels**: All Kubernetes labels with copy functionality
- **Annotations**: All annotations with copy functionality and special formatting
- **Configuration**: Hosts, paths, backend services, and load balancer status
- **YAML Manifest**: Syntax-highlighted YAML with copy-to-clipboard functionality

### URL-Based Navigation

Share direct links to specific ingress details:
- Modal state is reflected in the URL
- Navigate directly to ingress details via URL
- Bookmark specific ingresses for quick access
- Share links with team members

### Settings and Customization

Configure which labels, namespaces, and annotations appear in filters:

- Access settings via the Settings link in the header
- Exclude specific labels from filter dropdowns
- Exclude specific namespaces from filter dropdowns
- Exclude specific annotations from filter dropdowns
- Settings persist in browser localStorage

### Keyboard Navigation

Quick navigation using keyboard shortcuts:
- **Cmd+K / Ctrl+K**: Open Spotlight search for quick navigation
- Navigate to Dashboard, Settings pages, and more
- Accessible keyboard-first interface

### TLS Visualization

Clear indicators for TLS-enabled ingresses:

- User-friendly error messages

### Health Checks

Monitor Kubernetes API connectivity:
- Liveness and readiness probes
- Health check endpoint at `/api/health`
- Automatic reconnection on connection loss

## Security

### Security Headers

Built-in security headers middleware:
- Content Security Policy
- X-Frame-Options
- X-Content-Type-Options
