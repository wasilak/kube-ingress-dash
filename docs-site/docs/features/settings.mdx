# Settings and Customization

The settings screen allows you to customize which labels, namespaces, and annotations appear in the dashboard filter dropdowns, helping you focus on the most relevant filters for your workflow.

## Accessing Settings

Click the "Settings" link in the dashboard header (next to the application title) to access the settings screen.

## Settings Tabs

The settings screen is organized into three tabs:

### Namespaces Tab

Control which namespaces appear in the namespace filter dropdown.

**Features:**
- Multi-select component showing all available namespaces
- All namespaces are included by default
- Deselect namespaces to exclude them from the filter
- Count of excluded namespaces shown
- Changes save automatically to browser localStorage

**Use cases:**
- Hide system namespaces (kube-system, kube-public, etc.)
- Focus on specific application namespaces
- Simplify namespace filter for team members
- Reduce clutter in multi-tenant clusters

**Example:**
```
Exclude namespaces like:
- kube-system
- kube-public
- kube-node-lease
- default (if not used)
```

### Labels Tab

Control which labels appear in the label filter dropdown.

**Features:**
- Multi-select component showing all labels found on ingresses
- All labels are included by default
- Deselect labels to exclude them from the filter
- Count of excluded labels shown
- Changes save automatically to browser localStorage

**Use cases:**
- Hide internal/system labels
- Focus on business-relevant labels
- Simplify label filter for specific workflows
- Remove labels that aren't useful for filtering

**Example:**
```
Exclude labels like:
- app.kubernetes.io/managed-by
- helm.sh/chart
- app.kubernetes.io/instance
- Internal tracking labels
```

### Annotations Tab

Control which annotations appear in the annotation filter dropdown.

**Features:**
- Multi-select component showing all annotations found on ingresses
- All annotations are included by default
- Deselect annotations to exclude them from the filter
- Count of excluded annotations shown
- Changes save automatically to browser localStorage

**Use cases:**
- Hide verbose controller annotations
- Focus on custom annotations
- Simplify annotation filter
- Remove annotations that aren't useful for filtering

**Example:**
```
Exclude annotations like:
- kubectl.kubernetes.io/last-applied-configuration
- field.cattle.io/* (Rancher annotations)
- Long certificate manager annotations
- Internal metadata annotations
```

## How Settings Work

### Automatic Discovery

The dashboard automatically discovers all unique:
- Namespaces from ingress resources
- Labels from ingress resources
- Annotations from ingress resources

These are presented in the settings multi-select components.

### Inclusion by Default

All discovered items are included by default. You explicitly exclude items you don't want to see in filters.

### Real-time Updates

When you change settings:
1. Changes save immediately to browser localStorage
2. Dashboard filters update automatically
3. Excluded items disappear from filter dropdowns
4. No page refresh required

### Persistence

Settings are stored in browser localStorage:
- Persist across browser sessions
- Specific to each browser/device
- Not synced across devices
- Cleared when browser data is cleared

## Using Settings

### Excluding Items

1. Navigate to Settings
2. Select the appropriate tab (Namespaces, Labels, or Annotations)
3. Click the multi-select dropdown
4. Deselect items you want to exclude
5. Close the dropdown - changes save automatically

### Including Items Again

1. Navigate to Settings
2. Select the appropriate tab
3. Click the multi-select dropdown
4. Select items you want to include again
5. Close the dropdown - changes save automatically

### Resetting to Defaults

To reset settings:
1. Navigate to Settings
2. Select the appropriate tab
3. Click the multi-select dropdown
4. Select all items
5. Close the dropdown

Or clear browser localStorage:
```javascript
localStorage.removeItem('kube-ingress-dash-settings')
```

## Impact on Dashboard

### Filter Dropdowns

Excluded items do not appear in:
- Namespace filter dropdown
- Label filter dropdown
- Annotation filter dropdown

### Ingress Display

Settings only affect filter dropdowns, not:
- Ingress card display
- Ingress details modal
- Search functionality
- Grouping functionality

All ingresses remain visible and searchable regardless of settings.

### Search

Search functionality is not affected by settings:
- You can still search for excluded namespaces
- You can still search for excluded labels
- You can still search for excluded annotations

Settings only control what appears in filter dropdowns.

## Best Practices

### For Small Teams

Exclude:
- System namespaces
- Internal labels
- Verbose annotations

Keep:
- Application namespaces
- Business labels
- Custom annotations

### For Large Clusters

Exclude:
- Unused namespaces
- Auto-generated labels
- Controller-specific annotations

Keep:
- Active namespaces
- Team/project labels
- Custom routing annotations

### For Specific Workflows

**Development:**
- Include dev/staging namespaces
- Include environment labels
- Include debug annotations

**Production:**
- Include production namespaces
- Include release labels
- Include monitoring annotations

**Security Audits:**
- Include all namespaces
- Include security labels
- Include TLS annotations

## Keyboard Navigation

The settings screen is fully keyboard accessible:
- Tab through multi-select components
- Arrow keys to navigate options
- Space/Enter to select/deselect
- Escape to close dropdowns

## Spotlight Integration

Quick access to settings via Spotlight (Cmd+K / Ctrl+K):
- "Go to Settings - Namespaces"
- "Go to Settings - Labels"
- "Go to Settings - Annotations"

## Examples

### Hiding System Namespaces

1. Go to Settings → Namespaces tab
2. Open the multi-select dropdown
3. Deselect: kube-system, kube-public, kube-node-lease
4. Close dropdown
5. Return to dashboard
6. Namespace filter now only shows application namespaces

### Focusing on Team Labels

1. Go to Settings → Labels tab
2. Open the multi-select dropdown
3. Deselect all Helm and Kubernetes system labels
4. Keep only team/project labels selected
5. Close dropdown
6. Label filter now only shows relevant team labels

### Simplifying Annotation Filters

1. Go to Settings → Annotations tab
2. Open the multi-select dropdown
3. Deselect verbose controller annotations
4. Keep only custom routing annotations
5. Close dropdown
6. Annotation filter is now much simpler
