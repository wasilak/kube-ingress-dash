# Design: RBAC Documentation

## Overview
Provide clear documentation for RBAC setup, including example manifests and troubleshooting tips. Link docs from error screens and main documentation.

## Key Components
- RBAC docs page (Markdown)
- Example Role/RoleBinding manifests
- Troubleshooting section

## Flow
1. User accesses RBAC docs from app or main docs
2. Docs provide setup steps and examples
3. Troubleshooting tips for common issues

## Considerations
- Keep docs up to date with Kubernetes versions
- Make examples easy to copy
- Link from relevant error screens
