The goal is to provide a modern, structured, and interactive documentation experience with enhanced visualization capabilities.\n\n## Alignment with Product Vision\n\nThe Docusaurus migration supports the product vision by:\n- Providing a more professional and user-friendly documentation experience\n- Enabling better organization and navigation of documentation\n- Adding visual diagrams to help users understand the architecture\n- Making it easier for users to find deployment instructions for their specific needs\n\n## Requirements\n\n### Requirement 1: Docusaurus Setup and Configuration\n\n**User Story:** As a developer, I want to migrate the documentation to Docusaurus, so that users have a modern, searchable, and well-structured documentation experience.\n\n#### Acceptance Criteria\n\n1. WHEN users visit the documentation site THEN they SHALL see a Docusaurus-based interface with proper navigation\n2. IF the documentation site is accessed THEN it SHALL load with a consistent Docusaurus theme\n3. WHEN documentation is searched THEN users SHALL be able to find relevant content efficiently\n\n### Requirement 2: Content Migration and Structure\n\n**User Story:** As a user, I want the existing documentation to be properly migrated to Docusaurus with appropriate organization, so that information is easier to find and consume.\n\n#### Acceptance Criteria\n\n1. WHEN users navigate the documentation THEN all existing content SHALL be accessible in the new structure\n2. IF content exists about deployment THEN it SHALL be organized in a dedicated deployment section\n3. WHEN users read the documentation THEN content SHALL be properly formatted for the Docusaurus format\n\n### Requirement 3: Architecture Visualization\n\n**User Story:** As a user, I want to see architecture diagrams using Mermaid.js, so that I can better understand how kube-ingress-dash interacts with Kubernetes.\n\n#### Acceptance Criteria\n\n1. WHEN users read the architecture documentation THEN they SHALL see Mermaid.js diagrams showing component interactions\n2. IF diagrams illustrate Kubernetes integration THEN they SHALL clearly show the relationship between kube-ingress-dash and Kubernetes resources\n3. WHEN diagrams are displayed THEN they SHALL be properly rendered as part of the documentation\n\n### Requirement 4: Deployment-Specific Documentation\n\n**User Story:** As a user, I want dedicated pages for different deployment methods, so that I can find the specific instructions for my preferred deployment approach.\n\n#### Acceptance Criteria\n\n1. WHEN users visit the deployment section THEN they SHALL find separate pages for source, Docker, and Helm deployments\n2. IF a user selects Docker deployment instructions THEN they SHALL see Docker-specific content\n3. WHEN users access Helm deployment docs THEN they SHALL see Helm-specific configurations and commands\n\n### Requirement 5: GitHub Pages Deployment\n\n**User Story:** As a maintainer, I want the Docusaurus documentation to be deployed to GitHub Pages, so that it's automatically updated from the main branch.\n\n#### Acceptance Criteria\n\n1. WHEN changes are pushed to the main branch THEN the documentation site SHALL be automatically rebuilt and deployed\n2. IF documentation files are modified THEN the deployment workflow SHALL trigger and update the site\n3. WHEN the documentation is deployed THEN it SHALL be accessible at https://wasilak.github.io/kube-ingress-dash/\n\n### Requirement 6: Clean Docusaurus Installation\n\n**User Story:** As a maintainer, I want the Docusaurus installation to be clean without template content, so that the documentation site only contains relevant project information.\n\n#### Acceptance Criteria\n\n1. WHEN users visit the documentation site THEN they SHALL see only project-specific content\n2. IF template content exists THEN it SHALL be removed from the final site\n3. WHEN the site is built THEN it SHALL not contain Docusaurus example content or tutorials\n\n### Requirement 7: README Enhancement\n\n**User Story:** As a visitor to the repository, I want an engaging and modern README, so that I get a clear understanding of the project and its value proposition quickly.\n\n#### Acceptance Criteria\n\n1. WHEN visitors view the README THEN they SHALL see an entertaining and appealing presentation\n2. IF the README is viewed on GitHub THEN it SHALL be visually appealing and fun to read\n3. WHEN users read the README THEN they SHALL quickly understand the project's purpose and value\n\n### Requirement 8: Project Summary\n\n**User Story:** As a user, I want a clear project summary, so that I can quickly understand what kube-ingress-dash does in a single sentence.\n\n#### Acceptance Criteria\n\n1. WHEN users encounter the project THEN they SHALL see a clear 1-sentence summary of no more than 300-350 characters\n2. IF the summary is used in GitHub repo description THEN it SHALL accurately describe the project's purpose\n3. WHEN users read the summary THEN they SHALL understand the project's core functionality\n\n### Requirement 9: Proper Isolation\n\n**User Story:** As a maintainer, I want the Docusaurus documentation to be isolated as a separate npm project, so that dependencies don't conflict with the main application.\n\n#### Acceptance Criteria\n\n1. WHEN documentation dependencies are managed THEN they SHALL be separate from the main application dependencies\n2. IF documentation dependencies need updating THEN it SHALL not affect the main application\n3. WHEN the documentation is built THEN it SHALL use its own package.json and build process\n\n### Requirement 10: Git Ignore Configuration\n\n**User Story:** As a developer, I want .gitignore properly updated for Docusaurus, so that build artifacts and temporary files are not committed to the repository.\n\n#### Acceptance Criteria\n\n1. WHEN Docusaurus build artifacts are generated THEN they SHALL be excluded from git commits\n2. IF temporary Docusaurus files exist THEN they SHALL be properly ignored by git\n3. WHEN .gitignore is reviewed THEN it SHALL include all necessary Docusaurus-specific patterns\n\n## Non-Functional Requirements\n\n### Code Architecture and Modularity\n- **Isolated Dependencies**: Documentation dependencies shall be managed separately from application dependencies\n- **Modular Structure**: Documentation shall be organized in logical categories with clear navigation\n- **Build Separation**: Documentation build process shall be independent of application build process\n\n### Performance\n- The documentation site SHALL load quickly with optimized assets\n- Search functionality SHALL work efficiently across all documentation pages\n- Mobile responsiveness SHALL be maintained across all documentation pages\n\n### Security\n- Documentation deployment process SHALL follow security best practices\n- No sensitive information SHALL be included in the documentation site\n- External dependencies in documentation SHALL be properly validated\n\n### Reliability\n- GitHub Actions deployment SHALL be reliable and consistent\n- Documentation site SHALL have high availability\n- Build process SHALL handle errors gracefully\n\n### Usability\n- Navigation SHALL be intuitive and consistent across all pages\n- Content SHALL be well-organized with clear headings and sections\n- Search functionality SHALL help users quickly find relevant information",
