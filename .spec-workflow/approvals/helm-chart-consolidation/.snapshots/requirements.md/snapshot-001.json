Additionally, it defines requirements for implementing GitHub Actions-based CI/CD pipelines for both Docker image and Helm chart deployment to OCI registries.\n\n## Alignment with Product Vision\n\nThe consolidation of Helm charts and modernization of deployment practices directly supports the product vision by:\n- Simplifying the deployment process for users of the kube-ingress-dash dashboard\n- Ensuring reliable and consistent deployments across different Kubernetes environments\n- Following industry-standard practices for container and chart distribution\n- Supporting the goal of providing a smooth, easy-to-deploy Kubernetes monitoring solution\n\n## Requirements\n\n### Requirement 1\n\n**User Story:** As a DevOps engineer, I want a single, well-documented Helm chart named after the project, so that I can easily deploy the kube-ingress-dash dashboard with predictable, consistent configurations.\n\n#### Acceptance Criteria\n\n1. WHEN a user looks for the Helm chart for kube-ingress-dash THEN the chart SHALL be named \"kube-ingress-dash\"\n2. IF there are multiple chart directories in the repository THEN ONLY the chart named \"kube-ingress-dash\" SHALL remain\n3. WHEN a user inspects the chart directory THEN the chart SHALL include all necessary Kubernetes resources for deployment\n\n### Requirement 2\n\n**User Story:** As a platform engineer, I want a consolidated Helm chart that incorporates the best features from both existing charts, so that I can leverage the most comprehensive and well-configured deployment option.\n\n#### Acceptance Criteria\n\n1. WHEN deploying the chart THEN ALL essential features from both previous charts SHALL be incorporated\n2. IF the k8s-ingress-dashboard chart had RBAC configurations that the kube-ingress-dash chart lacks THEN the consolidated chart SHALL include these RBAC configurations\n3. WHEN comparing both charts THEN the consolidated chart SHALL include the most complete NOTES.txt documentation\n\n### Requirement 3\n\n**User Story:** As a security-conscious operator, I want the Helm chart to follow security best practices, so that the deployed dashboard has minimal security vulnerabilities and follows RBAC principles.\n\n#### Acceptance Criteria\n\n1. WHEN the chart is deployed THEN the ServiceAccount SHALL use least-privilege permissions\n2. IF the dashboard needs to access Kubernetes API THEN appropriate RBAC rules SHALL be defined with minimal required permissions\n3. WHEN security scanning tools analyze the chart THEN it SHALL pass without critical or high severity issues\n\n### Requirement 4\n\n**User Story:** As a DevOps engineer, I want GitHub Actions to build and push Docker images to GHCR, so that I can deploy the latest versions of the application with confidence in the image provenance.\n\n#### Acceptance Criteria\n\n1. WHEN code is pushed to the main branch THEN GitHub Actions SHALL build Docker images for linux/amd64 and linux/arm64 platforms\n2. IF a semver tag is pushed (v*.*.*) THEN GitHub Actions SHALL build and tag the Docker image with the version\n3. WHEN Docker images are pushed THEN they SHALL be signed using cosign for security verification\n\n### Requirement 5\n\n**User Story:** As a platform administrator, I want Helm charts to be published to an OCI registry, so that I can easily pull and deploy them with modern Helm clients following current OCI standards.\n\n#### Acceptance Criteria\n\n1. WHEN a release is created THEN the Helm chart SHALL be published to the GitHub Container Registry as an OCI artifact\n2. IF a semver tag is pushed (v*.*.*) THEN the Helm chart SHALL be versioned accordingly in the OCI registry\n3. WHEN users install the chart THEN they SHALL be able to pull it from the OCI registry using standard Helm commands\n\n### Requirement 6\n\n**User Story:** As an operator, I want comprehensive configuration options in the Helm chart, so that I can customize the deployment to fit different environments and requirements.\n\n#### Acceptance Criteria\n\n1. WHEN the chart is installed THEN all major parameters SHALL be configurable through values.yaml\n2. IF resource limits or requests are specified THEN the chart SHALL apply them to the deployment\n3. WHEN ingress is enabled THEN the chart SHALL properly configure ingress resources with Kubernetes version compatibility\n\n## Non-Functional Requirements\n\n### Code Architecture and Modularity\n- **Single Responsibility Principle**: Each file should have a single, well-defined purpose\n- **Modular Design**: Components, utilities, and services should be isolated and reusable\n- **Dependency Management**: Minimize interdependencies between modules\n- **Clear Interfaces**: Define clean contracts between components and layers\n\n### Performance\n- The consolidated chart SHALL maintain efficient resource usage as defined in tech.md\n- The chart SHALL support appropriate liveness and readiness probes for container health checks\n- Resource limits and requests SHALL be configurable to optimize performance in different environments\n\n### Security\n- The chart SHALL implement least-privilege RBAC permissions for the service account\n- Docker images SHALL be built using minimal base images\n- All GitHub Actions workflows SHALL use secure authentication practices\n- Images and charts SHALL be signed to ensure integrity\n\n### Reliability\n- The chart SHALL include appropriate Kubernetes health checks\n- Deployment strategy SHALL ensure zero-downtime updates where possible\n- The chart SHALL handle different Kubernetes API versions appropriately\n- GitHub Actions SHALL include proper error handling and notifications\n\n### Usability\n- The chart SHALL include comprehensive NOTES.txt with clear installation and usage instructions\n- Configuration options SHALL be well-documented with clear examples\n- Default values SHALL work for common deployment scenarios\n- The chart SHALL follow Helm best practices for naming and structure",
