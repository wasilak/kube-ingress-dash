  "content": "# Product Steering Document: kube-ingress-dash\n\n## Vision\nA real-time Kubernetes ingress monitoring and navigation dashboard that provides users with an intuitive interface to discover, access, and monitor services running in Kubernetes clusters.\n\n## Mission\nTo provide a lightweight, efficient dashboard that visualizes ingress resources in Kubernetes clusters, enabling users to quickly navigate to services and monitor their status in real-time.\n\n## Core Values\n- **Simplicity**: Clean, intuitive interface focused on the core functionality of ingress navigation\n- **Real-time**: Immediate updates when ingress resources change in the cluster\n- **Accessibility**: Works both inside and outside Kubernetes clusters with proper authentication\n- **Visual Clarity**: Clear, attractive representation of services with easy navigation\n\n## Goals\n### Short-term (3 months)\n- Build a functional dashboard displaying ingresses with real-time updates\n- Implement search and filtering capabilities\n- Support light/dark/system themes\n- Ensure proper Kubernetes authentication (in-cluster RBAC, out-of-cluster contexts)\n\n### Medium-term (6 months)\n- Add health status indicators for services\n- Implement advanced filtering options\n- Add metrics visualization for traffic\n- Support for additional Kubernetes resources (Services, Endpoints)\n\n### Long-term (1 year)\n- Multi-cluster dashboard support\n- Advanced analytics and usage patterns\n- Custom dashboard configurations\n- Plugin system for extended functionality\n\n## Scope\n### In Scope\n- Real-time ingress monitoring and visualization\n- Navigation to services via ingress links\n- Search and filtering capabilities\n- Theme support (light/dark/system)\n- Kubernetes authentication integration\n- Docker containerization\n- Helm chart for deployment\n\n### Out of Scope\n- User authentication and authorization for dashboard access (for now)\n- Ingress creation/editing/deletion capabilities\n- Advanced security scanning\n- Service mesh integration beyond standard ingresses\n\n## Success Metrics\n- **Usability**: Users can find and navigate to desired services within 30 seconds\n- **Real-time**: Ingress changes reflected within 2 seconds of cluster updates\n- **Reliability**: 99% uptime when Kubernetes API is accessible\n- **Performance**: Dashboard loads within 3 seconds and handles 100+ ingresses efficiently\n- **Adoption**: Successfully deployable via Helm chart in various Kubernetes environments\n\n## Stakeholders\n- **Developers**: Need quick access to services during development and debugging\n- **DevOps Engineers**: Require monitoring of ingress configurations and service availability\n- **Platform Teams**: Benefit from a centralized view of all exposed services in the cluster\n- **Site Reliability Engineers**: Use for monitoring ingress health and performance\n\n## Risks & Mitigation\n### Technical Risks\n- **Kubernetes API Performance**: Large numbers of ingresses may affect API performance\n  - *Mitigation*: Implement efficient watch mechanisms and caching where appropriate\n- **Authentication Complexity**: Supporting multiple Kubernetes auth methods\n  - *Mitigation*: Leverage official Kubernetes client libraries for standardized auth\n- **Real-time Updates**: Ensuring consistent real-time updates across all clients\n  - *Mitigation*: Use Kubernetes watch API with proper reconnection mechanisms\n\n### Product Risks\n- **User Adoption**: If interface is too complex for simple navigation\n  - *Mitigation*: Focus on simplicity and intuitive design principles\n- **Competition**: Other ingress monitoring tools may offer more features\n  - *Mitigation*: Focus on core strengths of simplicity and real-time updates\n\n## Serena Tool Integration Requirements\n\n### Initialization Protocol\n- **At the start of each new conversation or task**: Call the `mcp_serena_initial_instructions` tool before using any other Serena tools\n- This provides the essential Serena Instructions Manual with critical information on:\n  - How to use Serena's symbolic code navigation tools\n  - Best practices for code search and manipulation\n  - Proper workflow patterns for code analysis and modification\n\n### Task Completion Verification Protocol\nAll tasks must follow the verification protocol before marking complete:\n1. Information Collection Verification using `mcp_serena_think_about_collected_information`\n2. Task Adherence Verification using `mcp_serena_think_about_task_adherence`\n3. Completion Verification using `mcp_serena_think_about_whether_you_are_done`",
