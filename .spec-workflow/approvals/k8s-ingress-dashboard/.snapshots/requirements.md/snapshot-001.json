It enables users to quickly discover, navigate to, and monitor their services through an intuitive React-based UI with shadcn components. The dashboard connects to the Kubernetes API to stream ingress changes in real-time and presents them in an attractive, searchable interface with light/dark/system theme support.\n\n## Alignment with Product Vision\n\nThis feature supports the goal of providing a user-friendly, efficient way to navigate and monitor Kubernetes services. It addresses the common challenge of discovering and accessing services in a Kubernetes cluster by providing a centralized dashboard that visualizes all available ingresses and allows for quick navigation. The real-time streaming capability ensures that the dashboard always reflects the current state of the cluster.\n\n## Requirements\n\n### Requirement 1: Real-time Ingress Monitoring\n\n**User Story:** As a cluster user, I want to see real-time updates of ingress resources in the cluster, so that I always have access to the current state of available services.\n\n#### Acceptance Criteria\n\n1. WHEN ingress resources are created/updated/deleted in the cluster THEN the dashboard SHALL update in real-time (within 2 seconds) to reflect these changes\n2. IF network connectivity to Kubernetes API is temporarily lost THEN the dashboard SHALL reconnect automatically and update with the latest state\n3. WHEN ingress resources contain custom annotations THEN the dashboard SHALL display relevant information from those annotations\n\n### Requirement 2: Visual Navigation Interface\n\n**User Story:** As a user, I want to see services presented as attractive blocks with names and links, so that I can quickly identify and access services.\n\n#### Acceptance Criteria\n\n1. WHEN the dashboard loads THEN it SHALL display ingresses as visually distinct blocks with service names\n2. IF an ingress has multiple host/path rules THEN the dashboard SHALL display all available endpoints as clickable links\n3. WHEN I click on a link in the dashboard THEN the service SHALL open in a new browser tab\n\n### Requirement 3: Universal Search and Filtering\n\n**User Story:** As a user, I want to search through all displayed ingresses, so that I can quickly find the service I need.\n\n#### Acceptance Criteria\n\n1. WHEN I type in the search field THEN the dashboard SHALL filter the displayed ingresses in real-time\n2. IF the search criteria change THEN the current filter SHALL be reflected in the browser URL\n3. WHEN I refresh the page with a search filter in the URL THEN the dashboard SHALL apply the same filter automatically\n\n### Requirement 4: Theme Support\n\n**User Story:** As a user, I want the dashboard to support light, dark, and system themes, so that I can choose the visual style that works best for me.\n\n#### Acceptance Criteria\n\n1. WHEN the dashboard loads THEN it SHALL default to the system theme preference\n2. IF the system theme changes THEN the dashboard SHALL automatically switch to match\n3. WHEN I manually select a theme THEN the dashboard SHALL remember my preference for future visits\n\n### Requirement 5: Kubernetes Authentication\n\n**User Story:** As a developer or cluster admin, I want the dashboard to authenticate properly with Kubernetes using standard methods, so that I can access ingress information securely.\n\n#### Acceptance Criteria\n\n1. WHEN the dashboard runs inside a Kubernetes cluster THEN it SHALL use in-cluster RBAC authentication\n2. IF the dashboard runs outside the cluster THEN it SHALL use standard Kubernetes contexts for authentication\n3. WHEN RBAC permissions are insufficient THEN the dashboard SHALL display a clear error message\n\n### Requirement 6: Docker Build and Helm Chart\n\n**User Story:** As a DevOps engineer, I want the application to be containerized and have a Helm chart, so that I can easily deploy it to Kubernetes clusters.\n\n#### Acceptance Criteria\n\n1. WHEN the project builds THEN it SHALL produce a valid Docker image with a multi-stage build\n2. IF I want to deploy to Kubernetes THEN I SHALL be able to use the provided Helm chart\n3. WHEN deploying via Helm THEN all necessary RBAC resources SHALL be created automatically\n\n## Non-Functional Requirements\n\n### Code Architecture and Modularity\n- **Single Responsibility Principle**: Each file should have a single, well-defined purpose\n- **Modular Design**: Components, utilities, and services should be isolated and reusable\n- **Dependency Management**: Minimize interdependencies between modules\n- **Clear Interfaces**: Define clean contracts between components and layers\n\n### Performance\n- The dashboard shall update ingress information with less than 2-second latency after changes in the cluster\n- The UI shall render quickly with 100+ ingresses without performance degradation\n- The search functionality shall filter results in real-time with minimal delay\n\n### Security\n- The backend shall securely handle Kubernetes API authentication credentials\n- No sensitive information shall be exposed in the browser or client-side code\n- RBAC permissions shall be properly validated before making requests to the Kubernetes API\n\n### Reliability\n- The application shall automatically reconnect to the Kubernetes API in case of network interruptions\n- The dashboard shall gracefully handle scenarios with no ingresses or cluster connectivity issues\n- The application shall have appropriate error handling and logging for debugging purposes\n\n### Usability\n- The dashboard shall be intuitive and require minimal learning to navigate services\n- All interactive elements shall be accessible via keyboard and screen readers\n- Visual design shall be clean, modern, and consistent with shadcn UI components",
